XKCD Click & Drag - Stitched View
------------

This is a copy of [XKCD 1110][http://xkcd.com/1110/], but with the entire (giant) image stitched together.

You can download the images from the "Output" folder. The original webcomic is [CC BY-NC 2.5][http://xkcd.com/license.html], and this is released under the same license.

Output Types
------------

All images are in the output folder, with a suffix indicating the scaling of the image. The tiles are resized before stitching, and the filenames of the stitches end with the size of the tiles. The scales are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>No.</th><th>Length of side of tile (px)</th><th>Scale</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>2048</td><td>1:1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td><td>512</td><td>1:4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td><td>128</td><td>1:16</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td><td>32</td><td>1:64</td>
  </tr>
</table>  

### Stitches ###

These are made of the complete image stitched together, and available from 32px to 512px. The current stitching code needs to be made much more efficient before it can be used to stitch a 1:1 scale picture.

### Masks ###

These show what areas of the image have data. Large portions of the image are intentionally left blank by the author, and the original website automatically fills these tiles with the appropriate blank color.

### Fragments ###

These are smaller parts of the image stitched together, for convenience.
